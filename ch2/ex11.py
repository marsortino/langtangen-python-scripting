# Extend the simviz1.py script such that it writes an HTML file containing
# the values of the physical and numerical parameters, a sketch of the system
# (src/py/misc/figs/simviz2.xfig.t.gif is a suitable file), and a PNG plot of
# the solution. In case you are not familiar with writing HTML code, I have
# made a quick introduction, particularly relevant for this exercise, in the file
